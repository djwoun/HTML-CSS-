      Oatmeal is a type of coarse flour made of hulled oat grains (groats) that
      have either been milled (ground) or steel-cut. Ground oats are also called
      "white oats". Steel-cut oats are known as "coarse oatmeal", "Irish
      oatmeal" or "pinhead oats". Rolled oats can be either thick or thin, and
      may be categorized as "old-fashioned", "quick", or "instant", depending on
      the cooking time, which is shortened by the size of the oats, precooking,
      and sometimes the addition of enzymes.

      Frosted Flakes or Frosties is a breakfast cereal, produced by the Kellogg
      Company and consisting of sugar-coated corn flakes. It was introduced in
      the United States, in 1953,[1] as Sugar Frosted Flakes. The word "sugar"
      was dropped from the name in 1983.

      Froot Loops is a brand of sweetened, fruit-flavored breakfast cereal
      produced by Kellogg's[1] and sold in many countries. The cereal pieces are
      ring-shaped (hence "loops") and come in a variety of bright colors and a
      blend of fruit flavors (hence "froot", a cacography of fruit). However,
      there is no actual fruit in Froot Loops and they are all the same
      flavor.[3] Kellogg's introduced Froot Loops in 1963.[3] Originally, there
      were only red, orange and yellow loops, but green, blue and purple were
      added during the 1990s. Different methods of production are used in the UK
      where, due to the lack of natural colourings for yellow, red and blue,
      Froot Loops are purple, green and orange, and the loops are also larger in
      size. Although the marketing side of Kellogg's misleadingly sold the idea
      that each individual loop color was a different flavor, Kellogg's has
      acknowledged that all share the same fruit-blend flavor.
